## Weather App

### Description

This is a simple and responsive weather information showing web app built with **HTML**, **Sass**, and **Modern JavaScript**. This will display current weather information in your location, and you can also enter any city in the world to view current weather details for that city.

When you visit this web app, it will first try to get your location by using your **browser's location details**, and if that fails, it will get your location by using your **IP address** and show weather details based on that location. The app will also change its **background image** based on the **City name**.
